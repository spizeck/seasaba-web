# What to Expect on Your First Dive in Saba

Saba is unlike any other Caribbean diving destination. There are no beaches, no cruise ships, and no crowds — just pristine reefs, dramatic underwater topography, and some of the healthiest marine ecosystems in the region.

## Before You Arrive

Make sure your certification is current and bring your logbook. If you haven't dived in a while, we offer refresher sessions to get you comfortable before heading to the deeper sites.

### What to Bring

- **Certification card** and logbook
- **Reef-safe sunscreen** — Saba's marine park is strictly protected
- **Light layers** — boat rides can be breezy
- **Sense of adventure** — the best dives here reward curiosity

## Your First Day

We start every visit with a site briefing and gear check. Your first dive will typically be a relaxed reef dive at **Tent Reef** or **Ladder Labyrinth** — both offer incredible biodiversity at comfortable depths.

## What You'll See

Saba's marine park is home to:

1. **Massive barrel sponges** — some over six feet tall
2. **Hawksbill and green sea turtles** — regular visitors to most sites
3. **Nurse sharks** — often resting under overhangs at Diamond Rock
4. **Schooling fish** — jacks, barracuda, and creole wrasse in large numbers

The deeper pinnacle dives like **Third Encounter** and **Eye of the Needle** offer encounters with pelagic species including reef sharks and the occasional dolphin.
