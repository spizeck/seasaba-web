## Brand Colors

### Primary Brand Colors
- **Sea Saba Blue:** `#171C8F` (PMS 2746 C) — headers, primary buttons, key accents
- **Sea Saba Red:** `#9D2235` (PMS 201 C) — sparingly for emphasis, warnings, or a single standout CTA

### Deep Tones
- **Abyss Navy:** `#0B0F3B` — dark backgrounds, footer, hero overlays. Darker than brand blue, creates deep-water feel without going pure black
- **Volcanic Slate:** `#2C3E50` — secondary text, subtle UI elements. Nods to Saba's volcanic rock

### Neutral Foundation
- **Drift White:** `#F5F6FA` — primary page background. Slightly cool-toned, not stark white
- **Pure White:** `#FFFFFF` — cards, content areas, contrast panels
- **Sand:** `#E8E0D5` — warm accent backgrounds, section dividers. Keeps it from feeling too cold/clinical

### Text Colors
- **Primary Text:** `#1A1A2E` — near-black with a hint of blue, softer than pure black
- **Secondary Text:** `#6B7280` — captions, metadata, supporting copy
- **Inverse Text:** `#FFFFFF` — on dark backgrounds

### Functional Colors
- **Success / Conservation Green:** `#2E7D6F` — conservation messaging, confirmations, availability indicators. Teal-leaning, not tropical
- **Warning:** `#D4A843` — muted gold, for alerts or attention without alarm
- **Error:** Sea Saba Red `#9D2235`

### Color Usage Principles
- Blue is the dominant brand color across the site
- Red is a secondary accent — use as deliberate punctuation, not a theme color
- Neither primary brand color should be used for large background fills
- The palette stays in the cool/deep range most of the time, with Sand as the warm counterpoint
- Avoid oversaturated tropical colors
- Avoid competing accent colors outside the brand palette
- Maintain high contrast pairings for readability

---

## Visual Tone
- Ocean-inspired palette grounded by brand blue
- Deep blues, slate tones, neutral sands
- High contrast for readability
- The brand red should feel like a deliberate punctuation, not a theme color

---

## Typography

### Font Stack
- **Headings:** Century Gothic
- **Body / Copy:** Open Sans

### Heading Style
- Confident and spacious
- Clear hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3 with distinct sizing)
- Century Gothic provides a clean, geometric feel that reinforces the brand's modern professionalism

### Body Style
- Highly readable at all screen sizes
- Short paragraphs (2–3 lines max)
- Open Sans is a versatile, legible workhorse that pairs well with Century Gothic's geometry

### General Rules
- Avoid novelty or decorative fonts — the two-font system handles everything
- Typography should do most of the visual work
- Use font weight and size for hierarchy, not color or decoration

## Layout Philosophy
- Generous white space
- Clear vertical rhythm
- Predictable structure
- Consistent spacing and widths

Consistency signals professionalism and trust.

## Homepage UX
- Emotion first
- Explanation second
- Conversion last
- Minimal copy
- Strong imagery
- One primary call to action

### Homepage Hero
- Use a **full-bleed static hero image** with **no color filter overlay** by default.
- The hero image may extend **behind the navbar** on the homepage.
- Ensure readability by:
  - Placing copy in an area of the image with clean negative space, **and/or**
  - Using a **subtle local gradient behind text only** (not a full-image overlay), **and/or**
  - A light text-shadow.
- Navbar on hero should stay premium:
  - Use a translucent background + blur or a subtle solid background on scroll.
  - Keep contrast high for nav links and the “Book Now” button.

### Homepage Motion Section
- The homepage may include **one** video background section as the **3rd major section**.
- The video section should include **one clear CTA** (e.g., “Explore Dive Sites” or “Book Now”).
- No autoplay audio, no fast cuts, and no aggressive motion.
- Mobile should use a static poster image fallback.
### Homepage Section Order
1. Hero (static image, behind navbar allowed)
2. One supporting static section
3. One video background section + single CTA
4. Static routing sections
5. Final CTA


The homepage should invite exploration, not overwhelm.

## Inner Page UX
- Clarity first
- Reassurance second
- Conversion where appropriate
- Breadcrumbs encouraged
- Clear section headings

Users should always know where they are and what to do next.

---

## Imagery Guidelines
- Prefer real diving imagery
- Favor wide blue water, walls, silhouettes
- Avoid stock-style smiling diver photos
- Images must support content, not decorate it

---

## Motion Guidelines
- Minimal and purposeful
- Subtle fades preferred
- No aggressive transitions
- Motion should never distract from content

---

## Components Philosophy
- Simple, reusable components
- Minimal UI chrome
- Buttons are clear and consistent
- CTAs are intentional, not everywhere

---

## Design North Star
The site should communicate:
"We are experienced, deliberate, and confident enough to slow down."
